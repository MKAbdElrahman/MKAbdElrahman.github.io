**Go prevents you from hiding behind programming language shortcuts.**

In other languages, there are always shortcuts and idioms that work in certain scenarios. While these can save you time, they can also leave you feeling like you're missing something and lacking mastery.

For example, in Go, there is one iteration construct, namely `for`, to define loops. We don't have constructors, we can live without inheritance, and the language is clean from the public-private-protected overkill.

Go is not overengineered like Java or C#, for example. But at the same time, you can optimize the amount of engineering you need. Go doesn't take a step in front of you.

This minimalist style fits my nature. The fewer number of keywords make me feel like I know what's happening and there are no secrets.

However, in other old languages, the community has built mostly everything you need and most of the time preconfigures all the connections to make you set up and ready. This could be great for some people, but for me, I like to start with an empty file and build my own world. I feel like I'm thinking at each step and understand all the trade-offs of what I'm doing. With experience, this process doesn't take time, and my mind naturally quickly finds all the relevant components and the right way to connect them.

One great example that comes to mind is project structure. Project structure is important; it's essentially the logical architecture of your system. Different people will tell you to use the folder structure because it's MVC, clean architecture, hexagonal, follows DDD principles, and so on. I'm against all of this. Go goes against anyone thinking for you.
