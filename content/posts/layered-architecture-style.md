The **layered architecture** is a monolithic architectural style that organizes an application into **horizontal layers**, each focused on **distinct technical concerns**.

**Understanding the Terms:**

* **Monolithic application:** The entire application is deployed as a single unit.
* **Distributed application:** Application components are split across different machines and communicate through a network.
* **Technical partitioning:** Application components are organized based on technical aspects like data access or user interface, rather than business domains.

**Layers in the Layered Architecture:**

The layered architecture typically consists of three core layers:

1. **Presentation Layer:** Handles external interactions, input and output.
2. **Business Logic Layer:** Encapsulates the core business logic of the application, independent of UI or data storage specifics. 
3. **Data Access Layer:** Bridges the gap between the business logic and data storage (database or other mechanisms). It handles data retrieval, manipulation, and persistence.

**Architectural Philosophy:**

The philosophy behind the layered architecture revolves around two key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer focuses on its specific technical responsibility, preventing overlap and promoting cleaner, more maintainable code. Business logic should strictly reside in the **business logic layer**, not the presentation layer.

2. **Directed Dependencies:** Dependencies flow **downward** in the hierarchy. Each layer **only knows and interacts with the layer directly below it**. This minimizes coupling and avoids tangled dependencies when making changes.

* **Presentation Layer:** Communicates with the **business logic layer** for processed data and user interaction handling, **not directly** with the data access layer.
* **Business Logic Layer:** Receives user input from the presentation layer, applies business logic, and interacts with the data access layer for data needs.
* **Data Access Layer:** Directly communicates with the database, handling data operations based on requests from the business logic layer.

Following these principles ensures changes in the data access layer implementation are **isolated** and don't directly impact the presentation layer. This promotes **loose coupling** and facilitates easier maintenance and future modifications.

**Open Layeres:**

While the core principles are crucial, some variations exist. **Open layered architecture** allows specific layers to interact with **non-adjacent** layers in the hierarchy, offering:

* **Improved performance:** Potential performance gains in specific scenarios by bypassing intermediaries.
* **Code simplification:** Code simplification for complex interactions involving multiple layers.
* **Flexibility:** More flexibility in specific situations where strict adherence to directed dependencies might hinder development or performance.

However, it also introduces:

* **Increased complexity:** Openings make the architecture more complex to understand and maintain due to additional dependencies.
* **Reduced modularity:** Interactions between non-adjacent layers can violate separation of concerns, potentially impacting modularity and reusability.

**Implementing Open Layered Architecture:**

Implementing an open layered architecture requires careful **consideration of trade-offs**. Generally, a **closed layered architecture** is recommended for its benefits in maintainability and understandability. However, in specific scenarios where the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, controlled openings can be strategically introduced with **clear documentation** and **thorough testing**.
