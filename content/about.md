# About

### **Mohamed Abdelrahman**

I am a Senior Software Engineer with a deep passion for building scalable backends. With over six years of experience working in both monolithic and microservices architectures, my current focus is on modernizing software systems through modular monoliths and event-driven architectures. I prefer coding in Go and Java, which I have used extensively to build AWS cloud-hosted RESTful and gRPC APIs, as well as backend services.

### **On This Website**

I document lessons learned or discoveries that I find exciting, hoping to share that sense of exploration with others. Occasionally, I challenge widely accepted but flawed ideas. And sometimes, I just dive into something new and interesting.

Sincerely,
