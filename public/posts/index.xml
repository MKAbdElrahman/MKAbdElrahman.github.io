      <description>What Is a Container? Link to heading Containers are like isolating an application so it thinks it&amp;rsquo;s running all by itself. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a virtual machine (VM) but uses the host&amp;rsquo;s operating system instead of its own. To start a container, you begin with a container image that bundles up everything the application needs to run, making it easy to share and distribute.
The isolation that tricks a container into believing it has control over a whole Linux machine is achieved through the use of namespaces and control groups.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive,‚Äù he said.
I was a little surprised, because though I‚Äôve gotten that comment before, it‚Äôs become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description>

      <title>How I Learned to Stop Procrastinating, &amp; Love Letting Go</title>

      <description>The end of procrastination is the art of letting go.
I‚Äôve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.
Until I didn‚Äôt. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description>

      <title>Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title>

      <description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description>
