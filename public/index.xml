      <description>The context package in Go has recently introduced cause-aware context cancellation functions. This update includes the WithCancelCause, WithDeadlineCause, and WithTimeoutCause functions, as well as the Cause function for retrieving the cause of context cancellation.
func WithCancelCause(parent Context) (ctx Context, cancel CancelCauseFunc) This function is analogous to WithCancel, but it returns a CancelCauseFunc that allows setting an error as the cause of cancellation.
func WithDeadlineCause(parent Context, d time.Time, cause error) (Context, CancelFunc) Combining features of WithDeadline with the ability to provide a cause for context cancellation.</description>

      <description>The AfterFunc function in Go&amp;rsquo;s context package provides a robust tool for scheduling the execution of a specified function after a given context concludes, be it due to cancellation or a timeout. This blog post delves into the practical application of AfterFunc through an illustrative example, shedding light on its functionality and potential use cases.
The AfterFunc Signature Link to heading func AfterFunc(ctx Context, f func()) (stop func() bool) ctx: The context that determines when the function f should be executed.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Link to heading To successfully follow and execute the App Deployment Workflow within a Kubernetes environment, you&amp;rsquo;ll need the following prerequisites:
Software and Tools Link to heading Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed on your local development machine to set up and manage the Node.js application.
Docker: Docker is essential for containerizing your application into a Docker image. Make sure Docker is installed and configured correctly to build and manage containerized applications.</description>

      <title>Simplify Configuration Management in Go with the &#39;conf&#39; Package</title>
      <link>https://mkabdelrahman.github.io/posts/go-conf-pkg/</link>

      <guid>https://mkabdelrahman.github.io/posts/go-conf-pkg/</guid>
      <description>The &amp;ldquo;conf&amp;rdquo; package is designed to make configuration management in Go straightforward and flexible. It allows you to define your application&amp;rsquo;s configuration as a struct and then parse it for both environment variables and command-line arguments. This approach makes it easy to handle different configuration sources, and the package provides a variety of customization options through struct tags.
First, you need to install the &amp;ldquo;conf&amp;rdquo; package:
go get github.com/ardanlabs/conf/v3 Define a struct that represents your application&amp;rsquo;s configuration.</description>

      <description>In Go, init functions play a crucial role in package initialization. They are used to set up the initial state of your application, and their behavior can be both powerful and tricky to manage. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the concept of init functions, their use cases, execution order, and common pitfalls.
What Are init Functions? Link to heading In Go, an init function is a special type of function used for package-level initialization.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Docker for Go</title>

      <description>What Is a Container? Link to heading Containers are like isolating an application so it thinks it&amp;rsquo;s running all by itself. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a virtual machine (VM) but uses the host&amp;rsquo;s operating system instead of its own. To start a container, you begin with a container image that bundles up everything the application needs to run, making it easy to share and distribute.
The isolation that tricks a container into believing it has control over a whole Linux machine is achieved through the use of namespaces and control groups.</description>
