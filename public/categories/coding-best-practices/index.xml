      <description>One way to construct an object in GoLang is by first creating an object of the type and then directly accessing the fields to put the object in a valid state.&#xA;user := &amp;amp;User{} user.Name = &amp;#34;Mohamed&amp;#34; user.Age = 29 The problem with this approach includes:&#xA;Forcing clients to delve into the source code to understand which fields are essential for initialization. Lack of validation. Exposing implementation details. Increasing the surface area of our type, creating more potential points of coupling.</description>

      <description>After reading Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s book Tidy First, I decided to check out another one by him. This time it&amp;rsquo;s about the best practices in Smalltalk. Even though the book seems old, its ideas are relevant. Let me introduce you to the first pattern from the book, called the Composed Method pattern. This pattern might have different names nowadays, but its main idea is to encourage using smaller functions with names that clearly say what they do.</description>
