      <description>When we transition to microservices, each service owns its data. Achieving transactions across multiple services isn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as with a single monolithic database.&#xA;One way to address this challenge is through sagas, which simulate distributed transactions using a series of local transactions. This approach was popularized by Chris Richardson and later analyzed by Mark Richards and Neal Ford in their book &amp;lsquo;Sotware Architecture: The Hard Parts&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;They examined how these factors affect saga characteristics:</description>
