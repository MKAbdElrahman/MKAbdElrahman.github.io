      <description>&amp;ldquo;A software module (class, function, package, &amp;hellip;) should have one and only one reason to change. One actor that is the source of change.&amp;rdquo; - Uncle Bob&#xA;On the surface, this principle might remind you of the Linux philosophy: &amp;ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&amp;rdquo; However, this is not Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s interpretation.

In the worst-case scenario of tight coupling, changing one component unexpectedly affects the other, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t directly collaborate. This interdependence creates a tangled mess, making modifications difficult and prone to errors.&#xA;However, software often thrives on collaboration. This is where loose coupling comes into play. Loose coupling promotes independence between components. They can function with minimal reliance on each other&amp;rsquo;s internal workings.</description>
