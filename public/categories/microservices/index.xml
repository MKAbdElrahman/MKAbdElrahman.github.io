      <description>In microservices, the idea of using a shared monolithic database is always rejected. There are several reasons why this approach is not advisable. Below are the key considerations that highlight the drawbacks of a shared monolithic database.&#xA;Change Control Link to heading Managing changes in a shared monolithic database is a complex task. Any schema change necessitates coordination across all dependent services, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. This coordination is required to ensure that all services are redeployed simultaneously to prevent schema mismatch errors, which can cause significant downtime and service disruption.</description>

      <description>Setting the Scene Link to heading Consider an online food delivery system with two essential microservices:&#xA;Menu Service: Manages the list of available dishes. Order Service: Allows customers to create and manage their orders. How It Works Link to heading Starting the Menu Service:&#xA;The menu service starts and loads a cache containing information about available dishes. This cache is distributed, enabling it to be shared across different services. Starting the Order Service:</description>

      <description>A communication style refers to the way microservices interact with each other to exchange information and complete tasks. There are two main communication styles:&#xA;Synchronous communication Asynchronous communication Synchronus Communication Link to heading In microservices architecture, synchronous communication is a method for services to interact with each other directly. It follows a request-response pattern, where one service sends a request to another and waits for a response before continuing. This is similar to how traditional client-server applications work.</description>
