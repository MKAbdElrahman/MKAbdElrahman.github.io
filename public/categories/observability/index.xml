      <description>Observability is the ability to understand the internal workings of a system by examining the signals it emits externally. This means you can gain insights into the system&amp;rsquo;s health and performance without needing to directly access its internal components.&#xA;There are several reasons why observability is important. It allows you to troubleshoot problems more effectively by providing you with the data you need to identify the root cause of issues. It also enables you to answer questions about how your system is behaving and to proactively identify potential problems before they occur.</description>

      <description>OpenTelemetry: A Standardized Approach to Observability Link to heading OpenTelemetry (OTel for short) simplifies how you gain insights into your applications&amp;rsquo; health and performance. It&amp;rsquo;s an observability framework that provides a consistent way to:&#xA;Instrument your applications: Regardless of the programming language, OTel offers language-specific libraries and APIs to streamline this process. Generate telemetry data: This data comes in three forms: metrics (numerical data), logs (event messages), and traces (which track request journeys).</description>
