      <description>The layered architecture is a monolithic architectural style that organizes an application into horizontal layers, each focused on distinct technical concerns.&#xA;Understanding the Terms:&#xA;Monolithic application: The entire application is deployed as a single unit. Distributed application: Application components are split across different machines and communicate through a network. Technical partitioning: Application components are organized based on technical aspects like data access or user interface, rather than business domains. Layers in the Layered Architecture:</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading The microservices architecture style represents an extreme form of decoupling tailored for large-scale systems where hundreds of developers collaborate simultaneously. By embracing logical, spatial, temporal, and technology decoupling, teams can work autonomously and iterate rapidly. In this post, we delve into how microservices reduce coupling at various levels, enabling scalability, agility, and independent deployability.&#xA;Microservices: Decoupling at Scale Link to heading Microservices architecture represents a paradigm shift in software development, embodying the principles of extreme decoupling to address the challenges of building and maintaining large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Simplify Configuration Management in Go with the &#39;conf&#39; Package</title>
      <link>https://mkabdelrahman.github.io/posts/go-conf-pkg/</link>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;conf&amp;rdquo; package is designed to make configuration management in Go straightforward and flexible. It allows you to define your application&amp;rsquo;s configuration as a struct and then parse it for both environment variables and command-line arguments. This approach makes it easy to handle different configuration sources, and the package provides a variety of customization options through struct tags.&#xA;First, you need to install the &amp;ldquo;conf&amp;rdquo; package:&#xA;go get github.com/ardanlabs/conf/v3 Define a struct that represents your application&amp;rsquo;s configuration.</description>

      <description>In Go, init functions play a crucial role in package initialization. They are used to set up the initial state of your application, and their behavior can be both powerful and tricky to manage. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the concept of init functions, their use cases, execution order, and common pitfalls.&#xA;What Are init Functions? Link to heading In Go, an init function is a special type of function used for package-level initialization.</description>

      <description>What Is a Container? Link to heading Containers are like isolating an application so it thinks it&amp;rsquo;s running all by itself. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a virtual machine (VM) but uses the host&amp;rsquo;s operating system instead of its own. To start a container, you begin with a container image that bundles up everything the application needs to run, making it easy to share and distribute.&#xA;The isolation that tricks a container into believing it has control over a whole Linux machine is achieved through the use of namespaces and control groups.</description>
