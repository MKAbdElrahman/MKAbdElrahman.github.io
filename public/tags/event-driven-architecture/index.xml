      <description>Scenario:&#xA;You have an event-driven application that needs to integrate with a third-party REST API (Service B) without modifying it. To ensure reliable message processing, you want to introduce Service A as a mediator that consumes events and interacts with Service B in an idempotent manner.&#xA;Idempotency Requirement:&#xA;Service A: Service A must be idempotent to prevent duplicate event processing. This means if the same event is received multiple times, Service A should only process it once.</description>
